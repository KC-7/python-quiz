# KC-7's Quiz (built using Python)

This terminal app was built using Python to demonstrate a wide range of different functions.
The quiz takes the user's name, provides a series of questions and options and provides a final result at the end of the quiz.
Each user input is validated to ensure the data is in the correct format.
A google spreadsheet is linked to the app to keep track of the usernames and scores, the info is sent on completion of the quiz. 
The user will be given an option to print the high scores leaderboard to the terminal at the end of the game. The high scores are sorted in the google spreadsheet.
